        paragraph1: "What can I sayâ€¦ those 16 weeks went so quickly, but they got one thing right CodeClan's course is INTENSE!!. One thing I loved about the course was the structure, the routine, waking up every morning and traveling into Edinburgh.",
        paragraph2: "This is week 2 post CodeClan and I feel I am in a great place, mentally I am re-charged and I have extensively applied for job opportunities, I have tackled difficult tech-tests already. To sum it up I feel happy with the start to my Software Development journey!",
        paragraph3: "To keep myself in a routine I thought it was crucial to keep coding and keeping the brain fresh, so I decided at the start of week 2 when I was awaiting interviews and tech-tests to create this portfolio website. It has been a real joy and also shown that I am serious about this space, using a familiar tech-stack to achieve this and then learning how to host the site on AWS was a pivotal reason for creating this site.",
